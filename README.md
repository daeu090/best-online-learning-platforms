## FAQ

**What's the fastest way to learn programming from scratch?**
Platforms emphasizing interactive coding like Codecademy or Dataquest get you writing actual code immediately rather than watching hours of theory. Start with a single language (Python works well for beginners), commit to 30-60 minutes daily, and build small projects that interest you personally. Consistency matters more than cramming long sessions occasionally.

**Do online course certificates actually help with job applications?**
Certificates from university-backed platforms (Coursera, edX) or recognized tech programs (Udacity nanodegrees) carry more weight than generic completion badges. Employers care most about demonstrable skills—portfolio projects showing what you can build matter more than certificates alone. Combine certificates with GitHub projects, contributions to open source, or freelance work for strongest impact.

**Which platform works best for career changers trying to break into tech?**
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) structures nanodegrees specifically for job transitions, with projects reviewed by mentors and career services included. Treehouse techdegrees similarly target beginners aiming for entry-level positions through intensive project work. Both emphasize portfolio-building over theoretical knowledge, which helps when you lack traditional computer science background.
